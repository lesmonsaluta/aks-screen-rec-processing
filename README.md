# Visualizations for Screen Recording Data

This notebook is the general notebook for generating the visualizations for the Screen Recording Data. 

## Important Note
These visualizations are always rendered into a Slide Deck. If the intention is to understand the data (and not necessarily mingle with the code), please refer to [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G4Dr3S5Zxq8vBmx89CUk5fQKOjIkC1eR). If you wish to see the raw data, please refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v_sX0Bk54mcdoEeNj0L2ysR0rMvYh_G54-tchhOd3oo/edit?pli=1#gid=1601729613) instead.

## Requirements
This notebook runs using Python 3, and is supposed to be compatible with the latest versions of the libraries.
Please ensure that the following imports will work for you: 

```
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

In the event that these libraries are not yet installed, please run the following command on your terminal to install a library:

```
pip install <library>
```

For example, to install seaborn,
```pip install seaborn```

## Running the notebook

The notebook is design to work in a linear manner all the time (i.e. simply clicking "Run All Cells" will be enough to generate the graphs).

## Updates

The notebook will be updated frequently whenever more data is encoded. Changes to the graphing will also be updated frequently, depending on the features of the data.
